            I am John Allen Blaxton. I was born and raised in Decatur, Alabama. 
            I began my college studies at Freed-Hardeman University where I played
            baseball and studied computer science. I transferred to UNA my junior 
            year and switched to an IT major. I am not a morning person though I do 
            not mind getting up if I have to (mostly to hunt). The first thing I drink in the morning 
            is probably an over-caffeinated energy drink. My hobbies include any sport 
            with a ball. I am a has been athlete who trys way to hard in intramural sports. I transfered in late but have won 10 
            intramural championships (I am very proud)  I have recently picked up golf because that is the sport where 
            every baseball player retires too. Outside of studying at UNA, I work online 
            for a company out of Huntsville. On a scale 1-10 on how technical I am, I would 
            say I sit around an 8.
